# Project

This project is for MP7 and its goal is emulate a simon game while using a "new" android feature or api.

### How to get access

* Clone the repository
* Open android
* "Open project"
* Choose the "Simon" folder inside the "simon" git repo, so like /simon/Simon

I think this should work.

### How to push changes

* 'git pull --rebase'
* 'git push'

preferably we work in branches and wont merge to master often.
